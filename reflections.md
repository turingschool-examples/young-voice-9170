Austin Moore's IC

* Completed all user stories including extension story within 2 hours.
* Realized too late that my relationships do not reflect those in the seed file. Those in the seed would have created more robust tests.
* I never used the StudentProfessor table, which may have made my code DRY-er (specifically on my alphabetize method). Looking forward to seeing how I should have made use of that table!
* Did not know we were supposed to add a readme and message, so I submitted a PR instead. Sorry for the inconvenience!
